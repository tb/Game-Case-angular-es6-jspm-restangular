GAME CASE
========================================================================

## Description
A video game showcase app written in Angular 1.x (for now!) and ES6, compiled with Babel, and built 
with modules / dependencies managed by JSPM.

Restangular will be used to consume data from the [Mashape Metacritic API](https://www.mashape.com/byroredux/metacritic-v2).

I made this app to explore using ES6 within the context of Angular 1.x, to explore architecting an application around future best practices (ES6, modules, Web Components, etc.), and to experiment with porting an Angular 1.x over to Angular 2.0 once a stable release becomes available.

...and because it's going to be awesome app, obviously.
